MYB is a large nationwide (NSW) RCT aiming to improve cognition and prevent decline into dementia (5 years post study) by condcuting online interventions to modifiable risk factors. One of the measured outcomes at baseline and every 3-12 months during the 3 year intervention is an automated episodic memory (EMV) test LOGOS. Standard EMV's are one of the best predictors of decline into dementia. This script aims at looking at what socio-demographic-medical-biological-lifestyle and numerous other factors predict and interact with EMV in a popultation of 4-5000 participants
